Calculus is the math of **change**.  
It studies how things grow, shrink, or move. In ML, it’s mainly used to optimize models (finding the best parameters).

## Key Ideas
---
- **Derivative** → The slope or rate of change. Example: how fast a car’s speed changes at a moment.
- **Gradient** → A vector of derivatives, shows the direction of fastest increase/decrease.
- **Optimization** → Using gradients to minimize errors in models.

## Why it matters in AI/ML
---
- ML models learn by **reducing errors**.
- Calculus helps adjust model parameters step by step using gradients.
- Example: Gradient Descent = the main method to “teach” neural networks.

## Real-World Example

**Burger Shop Pricing**
- You sell burgers. Profit changes based on price.
- If the price is too low → little profit. Too high → fewer customers.
- **Calculus (derivative/gradient)** helps find the “sweet spot” price that gives the **maximum profit**.
- In ML, the same idea is used to find the **best model parameters** that minimize prediction error.
