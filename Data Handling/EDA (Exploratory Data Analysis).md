EDA means **exploring and understanding your data** before building models. It helps spot patterns, trends, and problems.

## Correlations

- Shows **how features are related** (positively, negatively, or not at all).
- Helps in feature selection.

**Real-World Example**  
 In housing data: _House size_ and _Price_ usually have a positive correlation → bigger houses cost more.

---

## Distributions

- Looks at **how values are spread** (normal, skewed, etc.).
- Detects outliers or imbalances.

**Real-World Example**  
In an online store: most customers may buy 1–3 items, but some buy 100+. Distribution shows these outliers.

## Feature Insights

- Understand which features matter most.
- Can reduce noise and focus on useful data.

**Real-World Example**  
In car insurance data: _Driver’s age_ might be more important for predicting accident risk than _car color_.
