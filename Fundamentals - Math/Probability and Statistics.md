- **Probability** → The math of uncertainty (likelihood something will happen).
- **Statistics** → The math of analyzing data (understanding what already happened).

They are the backbone of predictions in AI & ML.


## Key Ideas
---
- **Probability** → Chance of an event (coin toss → 50% heads).
- **Random Variables** → Numbers representing outcomes (die roll = 1–6).
- **Distributions** → Patterns of outcomes (bell curve for heights).
- **Statistics** → Mean (average), Median (middle), Variance/Std Dev (spread).

## Why it matters in AI/ML
---
- Helps models deal with uncertainty.
- Used in algorithms like Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models, and Bayesian networks.
- Needed for evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall are all statistical ideas).

## Real-World Example
---
**Weather Forecasting**
- If the forecast says **70% chance of rain**, that’s **probability**.
- After a month, checking how many times it actually rained vs predicted → that’s **statistics**.
- In ML, probability helps us **predict**, statistics helps us **evaluate**.
